welcome to my new blog.

before i begin, what do i want to do with blogging?

<span class="more"></span>

- document ideas on the internet rather than scraps of paper
- journal life feelings and experiences
- share skills with others through tutorials, walkthroughs, etc
- vocalize the message of open source
- build community with similar minded beings

i've struggled in the past with motivation, but especially considering i am no longer swamped with school since i dropped out, i have no good excuse to not take the time to share my creations beyond dumps on github. i know my adventures, especially with open source software, are worth sharing, so here we go.
