the static web is still here and it keeps getting more powerful.

static websites are easy, as they deal with the abstraction of files. files are a [powerful concept](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/names.html) well supported by open source. from vim to git, files are easy to develop on. from Github Pages to Cloud Files, files are easy to serve. as in any domain, there are open source tools available to make development and deployment of static sites easier.

when i redid dinosaur.io only a few weeks ago, i knew i wanted it to be a static site. i looked around for open source nodejs blogging frameworks like the popular octopress and found hexo. i dived in and boom, a new site. however, as i thought about i wanted my website to be, i felt like i wasn't in as much control as i wanted. hexo focuses on blogging, but what if i want more?

beyond dinosaur.io, i want a tool i can use whenever i have an idea for a static site. wintersmith strives for this purpose.

beyond just wintersmith, recreating dinosaur.io has been a great learning experience and as there is still more that i want done i am sure it will continue to be. slowly and steadily i am learning how to do modern, professional web development, something i was never taught in school. while i might not have a business plan, i have enough projects to keep me busy while i find a popular, powerful stack and build up the skills to use it.
