my ideas have lead me upon a twisting road. it may even seem as though i have no direction, given the graveyard of abandoned projects on my github. i admit i have a strong tendency to jump from one excited idea to another.  <span class="more"></span> luckily i'm in a situation where this is possible, where i can take my time as i strive to be a self-employed open source developer. as i continue onward, i've learned from my distractions, even if they only contribute to another deprecated project.

i think the path i am on is twisting because although it goes to and fro, it still has a center that it revolves around. my ideas are converging: how to share resources, how to organize in groups, how to build an open source economy, how to be empowered with technology. my stack is settling: no more trying to reinvent the wheel when i know it is better to be on the fastest moving train for free. my passion is constant: open source.

in this case, right now, my path is making a circle. i started off my summer with a plan to work on [unbazaar](http://dinosaur.io/unbazaar/docs), and now i'm back with a plan to work on unbazaar. the time i spent doing other work may appear wasted, but the experience i've had is indescribable. i hope to continue along my path, wherever it leads, learning all the way.
