the static web is still here and it keeps getting more powerful.

static websites are easy, as they deal with the abstraction of files. files are a [powerful concept](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/names.html) well supported by open source. from vim to git, files are easy to develop on. from Github Pages to Cloud Files, files are easy to serve. as in any domain, there are open source tools available to make development and deployment of static sites easier.

when i redid [dinosaur.io](http://dinosaur.io) only a few weeks ago, i knew i wanted it to be a static site. i looked around for open source nodejs blogging frameworks like the popular octopress and found hexo. i dived in and boom, a new site. however, as i thought about i wanted my website to be, i felt like i wasn't in as much control as i wanted. hexo focuses on blogging, but what if i want more?

i want a tool i can use whenever i have an idea for a static site. [wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io) strives for this purpose.

so i rebuilt [dinosaur.io](http://dinosaur.io) again using [wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io). i loved every moment of it and still enjoy hacking on it. i still have some minor touch-ups to do before it should be considered complete, but the basic blog structure is there. i have ideas about future features, such as support for github repos to showcase projects

slowly and steadily i am learning how to do modern, professional web development, something i was never taught in school. while i might not have a business plan, i have enough projects to keep me busy while i find a popular tools and build up the skills to use them.
